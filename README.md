## Project Summary

The **PCMS** modernizes the prosecutorial case management process by consolidating case tracking, document management, and Odyssey court system integration into one platform. It provides role-based access for staff, supports secure uploads, and ensures data consistency through automated synchronization and validation.

**Key Features:**

* Web-based Java and MySQL architecture
* Secure user authentication and role-based access control
* Integration with Odyssey for automated case synchronization
* Phased rollout to minimize downtime
* Structured ETL data migration strategy
* Comprehensive multi-level testing approach


# Prosecutor Case Management System (PCMS) Implementation Plan - Midterm

## Project Overview

This project introduces a new web-based Prosecutor Case Management System (PCMS) designed to modernize case tracking, improve data security, and streamline communication across departments. The system integrates directly with the state’s Odyssey court management system to synchronize filings, case statuses, and records in real time.

## Objectives

* Apply the principles of system design and implementation to a real-world legal organization.
* Develop a structured implementation plan outlining objectives, resources, and risk management.
* Design a reliable data migration process with cleansing, transformation, and validation.
* Construct a testing plan that includes unit, integration, system, and user acceptance testing.
* Integrate project management concepts such as cost estimation, scheduling, and evaluation.

## Development Methodology

The project follows a **Phased Implementation Approach**, where modules are deployed in stages to reduce disruption and risk. Each component—case management, user authentication, Odyssey integration, and reporting—will be developed, tested, and released independently before expanding system-wide. This gradual deployment ensures accuracy, data consistency, and staff readiness.

## System Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

1. **Planning and Requirement Analysis** – Identify user needs, current challenges, and data requirements through interviews and document reviews.
2. **System Design** – Create architecture for a Java-based web system with a MySQL backend, including data flow diagrams and security models.
3. **Development** – Build core modules for case management, document uploads, user roles, and data integration.
4. **Testing** – Conduct unit, integration, and user acceptance testing at each stage to ensure functionality and compliance.
5. **Deployment** – Roll out the system incrementally by department, starting with the records team, then prosecutors, and administrative users.
6. **Maintenance** – Perform continuous monitoring, collect user feedback, and release updates to enhance stability and performance.

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

| Risk                                   | Likelihood | Impact   | Mitigation Strategy                                                  |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Data migration errors                  | Medium     | High     | Validate data before loading and maintain full backups               |
| API failure during Odyssey integration | Low        | High     | Conduct staged sandbox testing with state IT collaboration           |
| User resistance or adoption delay      | Medium     | Medium   | Provide training and gradual onboarding                              |
| Cybersecurity breach                   | Low        | Critical | Enforce encryption, multi-factor authentication, and CJIS compliance |
| Project delays                         | Medium     | Medium   | Use milestone-based reviews and resource tracking                    |

| Deployment          | Months 9–10 | Phased rollout, user training, and monitoring         |

## Data Migration (ETL)

**Extract:** Pull case data and documents from legacy databases and shared drives.
**Transform:** Clean duplicate records, align fields with new schema, and standardize identifiers.
**Load:** Import data into the new PCMS using secure batch uploads and verify record counts.
**Validate:** Run reports comparing migrated and source data, ensuring consistency across records.

## Testing Plan

| Test Type       | Objective                              | Tools   | Outcome                              |

| Unit            | Verify individual modules              | JUnit   | Functional correctness per component |
| Integration     | Validate Odyssey connection            | Postman | Successful data exchange             |
| System          | Assess load and security               | JMeter  | Confirm stability and uptime         |
| User Acceptance | Verify usability and workflow accuracy | Manual  | Approval for production release      |

## Installation and Conversion

Deployment will occur in phases, beginning with record clerks who manage case intake. A short parallel operation period will ensure no disruption in active cases. Once validated, prosecutors and administrative staff will migrate to the new system. Legacy tools will be decommissioned only after confirmation of full data transfer and functionality.

## Cost and Resource Allocation

Project costs include development labor, hosting infrastructure, data storage, testing, and staff training. The implementation consultant oversees technical coordination, while IT personnel manage network configuration, user permissions, and post-launch monitoring.

## Post-Implementation Review

Project success is measured by improved case processing speed, accurate Odyssey synchronization, reduced manual data entry, and high user satisfaction. Metrics and feedback will be reviewed quarterly, and system updates will be planned accordingly.

## Lessons Learned and Continuous Improvement

The phased rollout approach allowed early issue detection and minimized risk. User training improved adoption rates, and data validation procedures ensured accuracy during migration. Future enhancements will include advanced analytics, document automation, and tighter integration with law enforcement data systems.
